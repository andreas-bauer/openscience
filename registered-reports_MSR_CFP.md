# Call for Papers: MSR/EMSE Registered Reports 
EMSE, in conjunction with the conference on [Mining Software Repositories](https://www.msrconf.org) (MSR), is conducting a pilot RR track. 

## What are Registered Reports
* Methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and reviewed prior to research being conducted.
* Reduce/eliminate under-powered, selectively reported, researcher-biased studies.

## 2 stage review
* (MSR 2020) Phase 1: Introduction, Methods (including proposed analyses), and Pilot Data (where applicable). In Principle Acceptance.
* (EMSE) Phase 2: full study, after data collection and analysis. Results may be negative! 

Publication happens if protocol adhered to. Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted, if they are justified. Any deviation from the protocol must be justified and logged in detail to ensure replicability. EMSE J. Editors reserve the right to tighten eligibility criteria if necessary.

## Phase 1 Criteria
* Importance of the research question(s).
* Logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
* Soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical power analysis where appropriate).
* Clarity and degree of methodological detail for replication.
* Will results obtained test the stated hypotheses?

## Qualitative Research and RR
* No reason to assume pre-registration cannot be for qualitative methods such as card-sorting, grounded theory, coding, member checking etc.
* E.g. phase 1 may include details on survey respondents, survey instrument design, data collection techniques.

## Submissions
EasyChair will be used to handle Phase 1 reviews and feedback/rebuttal. EMSE's EditorialManager system will be used for the Phase 2 submissions, with OSF managing the registration. Reviews from Phase 1 will be shared with the Phase 2 reviewers.

## FAQ
Q. *How will self-plagiarism be handled?* <br/>
A. Self-plagiarism is where an author includes verbatim text from other, already published work. We expect this to be managed using the existing workshop/extension model; there will be sufficient new content in Phase 2 to clearly indicate this is a new piece of work.

Q. *What if I publish my Phase 1 proposal, and then someone scoops me by following the protocol?* <br/>
A. In practice, this seems quite uncommon. However, OSF has mechanisms to manage embargo periods, so this might be something we also consider in the future. Currently the MSR/EMSE model makes embargos impractical. However, tracks such as "new ideas" already pose this potential risk, so we don't anticipate extensive problems.

Q. *How does this process deal with exploratory studies, where there is no well-defined hypothesis?*<br/>
A. For now, we strongly suggest such studies target the New Ideas and Emerging Results Track of MSR: . We will focus on studies that have a clear, well-formulated hypothesis. 

Q. *What if my study changes as I gather data?* <br/>
A. RR have flexibility to deviate from the analysis plan. However, authors will need to provide solid reasons as to why they deviated from the plan.
