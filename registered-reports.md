# Registered Reports 
EMSE, in conjunction with the conference on [Mining Software Repositories](https://www.msrconf.org) (MSR), is conducting a pilot RR track. 

## What are Registered Reports
* Methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and reviewed prior to research being conducted.
* Reduce/eliminate under-powered, selectively reported, researcher-biased studies.

## 2 stage review
* (MSR 2020) Phase 1: Introduction, Methods (including proposed analyses), and Pilot Data (where applicable)
* (EMSE) Phase 2: full study, after data collection and analysis. Results may be negative! Publication happens if protocol adhered to. Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted, if they are justified. Any deviation from the protocol must be justified and logged in detail to ensure replicability

## Phase 1 Criteria
* Importance of the research question(s).
* Logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
* Soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical power analysis where appropriate).
* Clarity and degree of methodological detail for replication.
* Will results obtained test the stated hypotheses?

## Qualitative Research and RR
* No reason to assume pre-registration cannot be for qualitative methods such as card-sorting, grounded theory, coding, member checking etc.
* E.g. phase 1 may include details on survey respondents, survey instrument design, data collection techniques.

## Timeline
MSR 2020 research paper submissions will likely be due January 2020, so we anticipate requiring Phase 1 registrations by then or shortly afterward.

## Submissions
Mechanics for submitting will be clarified and posted here.
