# Registered Reports 
EMSE, in conjunction with the conference on [Mining Software Repositories](https://www.msrconf.org) (MSR), is conducting a pilot RR track. 

## What are Registered Reports
* Methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and reviewed prior to research being conducted.
* Reduce/eliminate under-powered, selectively reported, researcher-biased studies.

## 2 stage review
* (MSR 2020) Phase 1: Introduction, Methods (including proposed analyses), and Pilot Data (where applicable). In Principle Acceptance.
* (EMSE) Phase 2: full study, after data collection and analysis. Results may be negative! 

Publication happens if protocol adhered to. Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted, if they are justified. Any deviation from the protocol must be justified and logged in detail to ensure replicability. Depending on the number of accepted papers it will be decided if the papers will be published in one EMSE issue or split over several.

## Phase 1 Criteria
* Work is in scope for the MSR conference.
* Importance of the research question(s).
* Logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
* Soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical power analysis where appropriate).
* Clarity and degree of methodological detail for replication.
* Will results obtained test the stated hypotheses?

## Qualitative Research and RR
* No reason to assume pre-registration cannot be for qualitative methods such as card-sorting, grounded theory, coding, member checking etc.
* E.g. phase 1 may include details on survey respondents, survey instrument design, data collection techniques.

## Timeline
MSR 2020 research paper submissions will likely be due January 2020, so we anticipate requiring Phase 1 registrations by then or shortly afterward.

## Submissions
Mechanics for submitting will be clarified and posted here.

## FAQ
Q. How will self-plagiarism be handled? <br/>
A. Self-plagiarism is where an author includes verbatim text from other, already published work. We expect this to be managed using the existing workshop/extension model; there will be sufficient new content in Phase 2 to clearly indicate this is a new piece of work.

Q. What if I publish my Phase 1 proposal, and then someone scoops me by following the protocol? <br/>
A. In practice, this seems quite uncommon. However, OSF has mechanisms to manage embargo periods, so this might be something we also consider in the future. Currently the MSR/EMSE model makes embargos impractical. However, tracks such as "new ideas" already pose this potential risk, so we don't anticipate extensive problems.

Other FAQs on RR in general are at the bottom of [the OSF page](https://cos.io/prereg/).

Q. Will all accepted papers in Phase 2 be published in one and the same EMSE issue, much like for a "normal" special issue? <br/>
A. No, this will depend on the number of accepted papers.
