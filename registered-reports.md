# Registered Reports 
EMSE, in conjunction with the conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), is conducting a pilot RR track. 

## What is Registered Reports
* Methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and reviewed prior to research being conducted.
* Reduce/eliminate under-powered, selectively reported, researcher-biased studies.

## 2 stage review
* (MSR 2020) Phase 1: Introduction, Methods (including proposed analyses), and Pilot Data (where applicable)
* (EMSE) Phase 2: full study, after data collection and analysis. Results may be negative! Publication happens if protocol adhered to.

## Phase 1 Criteria
* Importance of the research question(s).
* Logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
* Soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical power analysis where appropriate).
* Clarity and degree of methodological detail for replication.
* Will results obtained test the stated hypotheses?

## Qualitative Research and RR
* No reason to assume pre-registration cannot be for qualitative methods such as card-sorting, grounded theory, coding, member checking etc.
* E.g. phase 1 may include details on survey respondents, survey instrument design, data collection techniques.
