# Registered Reports - Journal Policies

## Timelines
In general, one year is the expected time between Phase 1 submission and Phase 2 submission. Each conference will outline the specific dates. Reviewer continuity becomes challenging beyond this point.

## Submission
Submit Phase 2 registered report papers to EMSE via the [standard submission site](https://www.editorialmanager.com/emse/default2.aspx). 

Under special issues, select "RR" as your special issue. 

Include in your submission a cover letter which explains:
1. the fact this is a phase 2 submission;
2. the original venue at which phase 1 was approved;
3. any details about study protocol changes between phase 1 and phase 2.


## Authorship
Changes in authorship are permitted, however:

1. All authors must fill in and sign the authorship form which will explain who did what *and* that the authors satisfied and understood ACM and IEEE authorship criteria
2. Authors cannot advertise “in principle acceptance” and authorship as an incentive for participation in research studies
3. IPA (Stage 1) reviewers and their students cannot become authors on the final paper (since they ‘accepted’ it, there are ethical concerns)
4. There will need to be new COI checks on the new authors (and with large numbers it can become a real problem)
5. Authors should be made aware of second order effects (e.g., having many conflicts can complicate the review of their submissions) before participating

The author form can be obtained by contacting the journal editorial office.
