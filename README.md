# EMSE Open-Science Initiative

The Empirical Software Engineering journal (EMSE) wants to encourage open-science and reproducible research.
This repository describes the process and infrastructure that support this initiative.

## Open-science Board

Chairs: TBA

Board members: TBA

## Process

To give feedback about this proposal, there are two possibilities:
* comment on the pull-request discussion tread
* comment a specific line by clicking in the left margin)

Process description:

1. Once a paper gets "Minor revision", the decision email contains the following text:
    * "EMSE encourages open science and reproducible research. Not only is this good for science and the community as a whole (since progress can be faster), there is also strong evidence (TODO add short link) that it leads to more citations and more impact. A revision is no guarantee of future acceptance but if your paper is eventually accepted for publication in EMSE you will have the option to provide a replication package. We suggest to prepare for this already now. To get more information about the open-science initiative, please visit https://github.com/emsejournal/openscience"
1. Once a paper is accepted, the authors are invited to submit a replication package
    * upon acceptance, one of the EiCs forwards the paper to the Open-Science Chairs who selects a suitable Open-Science board member.
    * the acceptance email explicitly asks to submit a URL to the replication package.
        * email text: "EMSE encourages open-science and reproducible research and your paper can be badged as "open-science". To do so, please send an email containing the URL to the replication package at emsejournal.openscience@chalmers.se. To get more information about the open-science initiative, please visit https://github.com/emsejournal/openscience"
    * the authors are given 2 weeks to submit their replication package.
1. Once the Open-Science Board receives the URL to the replication package, the Open-Science Chairs asks one member of the Open-Science board to review the package.
    * The review is made according to a review guideline (TBD, add guidelines)
    * The open-science reviewer is given two weeks to accept or consolidate a list of questions to the authors
1. If necessary, the open-science reviewer ask for changes by sending an email to the authors
    * the authors are given another two weeks to make the changes.
1. The open-science reviewer makes his final decision.
    * If the replication-package is not good enough, the paper is still accepted, and the authors are given with a list of constructive comments on how to improve their open-science practices
1. If the replication package is considered of good or excellent quality, the authors can add in their final version. "Open-science Replication Package validated by the Open-Science Board"

Notes:

* It is discussed with Springer about potential support in the publication platform for the open-science metadata and badge in the published PDF.
