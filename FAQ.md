FAQ about the open-science process at EMSE
==========================================

**In this EMSE open science process, what’s the difference between reproducibility and replicability?**  
There is no consensus across disciplines about the difference between reproducibility and replicability. Often, replicability is seen as the ability to repeat the same study under the very same conditions yielding same results.
Reproducibility is seen as the ability to independently reproduce the study yielding same or similar results with a given precision. In the EMSE open science process, we make no specific difference for now. The goal is to encourage open data and code so that researchers can reproduce the results (partially or completely), and/or perform further research using this data and code.

**What happens if the data violates one or more of the FAIR principles?**  
FAIR is an interesting initiative which we follow attentively. It’s good if authors get to know, and ideally follow those principles, but it’s not required.

**Is restricted access sharing allowed (e.g., data is stored online but the link is not public and provided only if the interested party explicitly asks for it or signs a formal agreement with the data owner)?**  
We certainly understand that in certain contexts, unconditional data disclosure to the public is not possible. Open science, however, means that data is publicly accessible by anyone which is why the open science badges cannot be granted when data is shared in a restricted manner.

**When it comes to data about the humans, do we want to encourage or adhere to some kind of privacy regulations such as GDPR?**  
Privacy is a very important concern taken seriously by the open science board. When it is required for the data, proper anonymization of data is mandatory, in compliance with existing ethical codes of conduct and regulations such as GDPR.

**What happens if data or access to it are modified by the authors after the approval of the Open Science chairs?**
We count on the  authors’ ethics to avoid this inappropriate behavior. Note that once data has been released on an archival website (e.g. Zenodo), later modifications are not possible anymore. This is also one of the reasons why we refrain from disclosing data sets only on institutional websites or personal webpages.

**What does replication mean for qualitative studies, say ethnography research or action research?**   
Qualitative human studies can barely be completely replicated as human practices tend to be purely rational and reproducible in very rare cases only. In our understanding, however, data sharing can at least support comprehending the analysis results yielded by the researchers and the conclusions they have drawn based on their data. We consider, therefore, a qualitative study to be (sufficiently) reproducible when the shared data allows other researchers to understand the claims and analyses presented by the authors. For interview research, for example, the shared data should include the instrumentation, transcripts (potentially anonymized), field notes, and codebooks so that others not involved in the study fully understand how the authors inferred their conclusions.

**What does replication mean for systematic reviews?**  
Similarly as for qualitative studies, secondary studies can barely be fully reproduced. There exist multiple reasons for this, such as the different functionalities of different search engines yielding different results when repeatedly used in an independent manner. We consider a secondary study to be sufficiently reproducible when the reporting in the manuscript and the shared data and scripts allow to understand the claims and analyses presented by the authors.

**Why is the open science review process single blind?**  
It is for now single blind in order to be the least disruptive and to maximize acceptance (both from authors and from reviewers). We will consider alternatives in the near future.

**Will the absence of badges on research papers, as a result of confidential research data/artifacts, give the impression of a lower class science?**
No, the badge signals open data and open science. The absence of badge states does not mean that this is lower-class science, it only means that the authors cannot participate to the process or that the data was not open enough. In the presence of confidential research data or artifacts, authors will be encouraged to state in their paper the reasons for confidentiality in order to prevent misleading impressions.

**Will the absence of badges discourage research done on industrial proprietary datasets, that is potentially very valuable?**  
The journal does encourage and support high-quality research based on proprietary datasets which provides novel and unique insights.

**Are there multiple badges of different flavours, like the ones used by [ROSE](https://2018.fseconference.org/track/rosefest-2018)?**  
The actual badges are being discussed with the publisher. In the beginning, there will probably be one single badge to begin in order to keep things simple.
