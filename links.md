# Links on Open Science, Reproducibility, and Replication

## Reproducibility

### What different types of reproducibility is there? 
- [rOpenSci's Introduction](https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/) with an overview to reproducibility
- Stodden et al (2013). "[Setting the Default to Reproducible: Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf)", ICERM workshop.

### How to share credit (attribution) 
- Stodden's (2009) proposal for a [Reproducible Research Standard](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1362040)(RRS).

### New publication models
- [ReScience Journal](http://rescience.github.io/) for publishing the replication of existing computational research.
