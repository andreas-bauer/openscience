# Links on Open Science, Reproducibility, and Replication

## Reproducibility

### General introductions
- [Open Science in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06499), book chapter highlighting general principles, concepts and terms, and how-to's to open science (with focus on registered reports, open access, and open data) 

### What different types of reproducibility is there? 
- [rOpenSci's Introduction](https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/) with an overview to reproducibility
- Stodden et al (2013). "[Setting the Default to Reproducible: Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf)", ICERM workshop.

### How to share credit (attribution) 
- Stodden's (2009) proposal for a [Reproducible Research Standard](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1362040)(RRS).

### New publication models
- [ReScience Journal](http://rescience.github.io/) for publishing the replication of existing computational research.

### Research on Reproducibility
- Allison et al (2018). "[Reproducibility of research: Issues and
proposed remedies](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/11/2561.full.pdf)", introduction to special issue, PNAS, 2018.
